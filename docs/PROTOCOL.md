# Protocol Notes (Draft)

This file will define `constitute-nvr` contract details once gateway/web convergence reaches stable handoff.

## Planned Sections
- Capability advertisement schema (`service=nvr`)
- Source registration contract
- Retention policy contract
- Clip/query contract
- Health/metrics contract
- Auth envelope and signing requirements

## Guardrail
Protocol additions here must remain compatible with Constitution shared contracts and should be reviewed against:
